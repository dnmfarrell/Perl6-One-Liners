INTRODUCTION
------------

One thing that sets Perl apart from other languages is the ability to write small programs in a single line of code, known as a "one liner". It's often faster to type a program directly into the terminal than to write a throwaway script. And one liners are powerful too; they're fully fledged programs which can load external libraries but also integrate into the terminal. You can pipe data in or out of a one liner.

Like Perl 5, Perl 6 supports one liners. And just like Perl 6 cleaned up Perl 5's warts elsewhere, the one liner syntax is also better. It's cleaner with fewer special variables and options to memorize. This book provides many useful examples of Perl 6 one liners that can do everything from finding duplicate lines in a file to running a web server. Although Perl 6 has fewer special variables, because of its advanced object oriented syntax most of the one liners are shorter in Perl 6 than their Perl 5 equivalent.

This book can be read in a number of ways. If you're new to one liners, start with the (tutorial)[#tutorial]. It walks you through the core concepts of a one liner; don't worry - it's really very simple once you get the hang of it. If you're familiar with Perl, Bash or Sed/Awk, you can probably get stuck in to the examples right away. Feel free to skim and scan the material for whatever piques your interest. If you don't understand some code, try it out in the terminal! Included in this repo is the ubiquitous `example.txt` file which is used in many of the one liners.

Programming with one liners is just one paradigm that Perl 6 excels in. There's a beauty in the brevity of this code, but whilst you're learning a productive skill, remember that you're also learning the ropes of a powerful new programming language. Check out the [perl6.org](http://perl6.org) website for the official documentation.


TUTORIAL
--------

To get started with one liners, all you really need to understand is the `-e` option. This tells Perl to execute what follows as a program. For example:

    perl6 -e 'say "Hello, World!"'

Let's step through this code. `perl6` invokes the Perl 6 program, `-e` tells Perl 6 to execute and `'say "Hello, World!"'` is the program. Every program must be surrounded in single quotes (except on Windows, see [Converting for Windows](#converting-for-windows)). To run the one-liner, just type it into the terminal:

    > perl6 -e 'say "Hello, World!"'
    Hello, World!

If you want to load a file, just add the path to the file after the program code:

    perl6 -e 'for (lines) { say $_ }' /path/to/file.txt

This program prints every line in `/path/to/file.txt`. You may know that `$_` is the default variable, which in this case is the current line being looped through. `lines` is a list that is automatically created for you whenever you pass a filepath to a one-liner. Now let's re-write that one liner, step-by-step. These are all equivalent:

    perl6 -e 'for (lines) { say $_ }' /path/to/file.txt
    perl6 -e 'for (lines) { $_.say }' /path/to/file.txt
    perl6 -e 'for (lines) { .say }' /path/to/file.txt
    perl6 -e '.say for (lines)' /path/to/file.txt
    perl6 -e '.say for lines' /path/to/file.txt

Just like `$_` is the default variable, methods called on the default variable can omit the variable reference. They become default methods. So `$_.say` becomes `.say`. This brevity pays off with one liners - it's less typing!

The `-n` option changes the behavior of the program: it executes the code once for every line of the file. So uppercase and print every line of `/path/to/file.txt` you can type:

    perl6 -ne '.uc.say' /path/to/file.txt

The `-p` option is just like `-n` except that it will automatically print `$_`. So another way we could uppercase a file would be:

    perl6 -pe '$_ = .uc' /path/to/file.txt

Or two shorter versions that do the same thing:

    perl6 -pe '.=uc' /path/to/file.txt
    perl6 -pe .=uc /path/to/file.txt

In the second example we were able to completely remove the surrounding single quotes. This is a rare scenario, but in the event your one liner has no spaces and no sigils or quotes in it, you can usually remove the outer quotes.

The `-n` and `-p` options are really useful. There are lots of example one-liners that use them in this book.

The final thing you should know is how to load a module. This is really powerful as you can extend Perl 6's capabilities by importing external libraries. The `-M` switch stands for load module:

    perl6 -M URI::Encode -e 'say encode_uri("example.com/10 ways to crush it with Perl 6")'

This: `-M URI::Encode` loads the URI::Encode module, which exports the `encode_uri` subroutine. You can use `-M` more than once if you want to load more than one module:

    perl6 -M URI::Encode -M URI -e '<your code here>'

What if you have a local module, that is not installed yet? Easy, just pass use the `-I` switch to include the directory:

    perl6 -I lib -M URI::Encode -e '<your code here>'

Now Perl 6 will search for `URI::Encode` in `lib` as well as the standard install locations.

To get a list of Perl 6 command line switches, use the `-h` option for help:

    perl6 -h

This prints a nice summary of the available options.

DATA TRANSFORMATION WITH PIPES
------------------------------

Perl 6 programs integrate straight into the command line. You can pipe data in-to and out-of a one liner by using the pipe `|` character. For piping data in, Perl 6 automatically sets STDIN to `$*IN`. Just like with files, data piped in can be looped through using `-n` and is also available in `lines`. To pipe data out of a one liner just use `print` or `say`.

JSON-encode a list of all files in the current directory

    ls | perl6 -M JSON::Tiny -e 'say to-json(lines)'

CONVERTING FOR WINDOWS
----------------------

Running one liners on Windows is a piece of cake once you know the rules of the road. One liners work on both cmd.exe and PowerShell. The cardinal rule is: replace the outer single-quotes with double quotes and use the interpolated quoting operator `qq//` for quoting strings inside a one liner. For non-interpolated quoting, you can use single-quotes. Let's look at some examples.

Here's a simple one liner to print the time:

    perl6 -e 'say DateTime.now'

To run on Windows, we just replace the single quotes with double quotes:

    perl6 -e "say DateTime.now"

This one liner appends a newline to every line in a file, using an interpolated string:

    perl6 -pe '$_ ~= "\n"' example.txt

On Windows this should be written as:

    perl6 -pe "$_ ~= qq/\n/" example.txt

In this case we want to interpolate `\n` as a newline and not literally add a backslash and an "n" to the line, so we have to use `qq`. But you can usually use single-quotes within a one liner so:

    perl6 -e 'say "Hello, World!"'

On Windows can be written as:

    perl6 -e "say 'hello, World!'"

Simple output redirection works like it does on Unix-based systems. This one liner prints an ASCII character index table to a file using `>`:

    perl6 -e "say .chr ~ ' ' ~ $_ for 0..255" > ascii_codes.txt

When using `>` if the file doesn't exist, it will be created. If the file does exist, it will be overwritten. If you'd rather append to a file, use `>>` instead.
